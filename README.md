## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Saas
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Axios
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this challenge i got to work with Axios, which i've only used a couple of times in the past so i'm not very familiar with it, but it was fun to reinforce my knowledge about it.

Likewise i haven't worked a lot with APIs in the past, so it was also fun to figure out how the Advice Slip API worked.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about Axios and how to implement all kind of APIs on my projects, they seem really fun and they can be very powerful when you know how to implement them.

### Useful resources

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - This is the official Axios documentation, everything you need to know about Axios is there and it was very helpful for this challenge.
